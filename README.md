<h2>FAQ:</h2>

<p><b> Q: This plugin would lag my servers massively? </b></p>
R: That depends where your server is hosted from, or if it has many users with glow enabled.
With <b>Version 2.0</b>, all the new users are set without glow, by default, so they need to change with the <b>sm_glow</b> command.
Another option is to set <b>sm_glowmenu_flag</b> to any flag, just to restrict the maximum numbers possible.
